# 4180finalProject

This project is a videogame that is modeled after the old missile command game from the Xbox 360 gaming console. The basic idea of the game is that you will be controlling a spaceship that is protecting a city. The game will send missiles down toward the city and the spaceship must traverse horizontal airspace above the city to shoot down the misslies.
